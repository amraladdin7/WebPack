# Project Instructions

This project aims at using webpack along with service workers and calling external API. It gives the user a tool to type some text or copy and paste it and then it returns whether the text is subjective or objective.

## Instructions to start

1. Install npm and node.
2. run the command `npm install` to install all the required dependancies.
3. run the command `npm run build-prod` which will generate the dist file created by webpack.
4. start the server by running `npm start`.
